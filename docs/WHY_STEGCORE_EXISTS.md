# Why StegCore Exists

Verified truth alone does not grant permission.

StegCore exists to separate **what is true** from **what is allowed**.

---

## Separation of Responsibilities

- **StegID** proves continuity and verification.
- **StegCore** decides whether an action may proceed.

This separation prevents:
- authority inflation
- silent privilege escalation
- irreversible automation errors

---

## Constraint Enables Recovery

Systems fail.
Agents make mistakes.
Automation misfires.

Recovery requires:
- delay
- review
- consent
- escalation paths

StegCore provides these constraints as first-class concepts.

---

## Narrow by Design

StegCore intentionally does not:
- verify receipts
- store identity
- implement intelligence
- claim autonomy

It defines a **decision boundary**, not an agent.

---

## AI Positioning (Locked)

StegVerse does not claim artificial general intelligence.

It enables:

> AI systems that are accountable, recoverable,
> and constrained by verifiable continuity.

---

## Durability

This document should remain true even as implementations change.
